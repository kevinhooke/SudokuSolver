# SudokuSolver
My First attempt at implementing a Sudoku solver in Java.

I'm not an expert Sudoku player by any means, so I'm working out the logic to solve a puzzle as I go based on how
I would solve if playing by hand (it's entirely likely that the approach I'm using therefore is far from the 
best or most effective approach). I'm aiming for a working approach first, and then I'll come back and optimize later.

This is a work in progress :-)
